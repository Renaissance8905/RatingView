# RatingStars

This is a UI Control component written in SwiftUI. It shows a star rating field and updates based on user input.

* Supports both drag and tap interactions
* Pure SwiftUI, extremely lightweight library
* Comes with several pre-packaged icon sets (stars, hearts, etc.) to choose from, but also accepts any image you want to use!
* Fully customizable rating scale
* Uses SF Symbols by default, guaranteeing that image scaling and tinting will integrate cleanly with your app
